//NOTES - @ is a wait operator, similar to two opposite functions side by side "+-"
//* only change the active timeline that is being altered in the specific universe that is ececuted. So the * in the second universe
//	Means that every other command after that IN THE SAME UNIVERSE, should be executed to timeline x. It doesnt affect the remaining commands in

// In the second line an additional @ is provided just to make sure exectution has definately occured before trying to print again
